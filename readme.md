<h1>Frisbee Disc Golf</h2>
This project was undertaken as part of a piece of coursework at university. I decided to create a game that incorporates one of my interests outside of computer science: frisbee!

The game was created in Unity 3D, with the scripting being written in C#. By combing physically accurate rigid body calculations with custom forces and game logic, I was able to produce a fun arcade game that can be easily expanded upon and modified.

I was sure to develop the code base in such a way that future modifications and improvements could be easily developed without having to significantly alter already existing code. I decided to place strong emphasis on this aspect of development as I hope to continue to work on this project at a later date.

I really enjoyed working on this project as it gave me the opportunity to explore how modern game engines implement certain features as well as to improve my C# programming â€“ something I have long had an interest in.

<h2>How to Play </h2>
Complete each hole by getting the disc into the basket. <br>
By altering your power, aim and the tilt of the disc, change the trajectory of the throw to avoid obsticles<br>

<h2>Controls</h2>
